# Introduction

### Different types of n

1. Regression: the func outputs a scalar
2. Classfication: given options(classes), the func outputs the correct one.
3. ...
4. Structure Learning: create something with structure (images, document...) 让机器创造某种东西，这是一件不简单的事情。

### How to find the function we need

1. Function with unknow parameters.
    + y = f(  )
    + We can suppose a func based on domain data.  e.g. `y = x * w + b`
    + `x` is known data, called **Feature**
    + In ML, we call this `func y` **Model**
    + `w`, which multiplies with x is called **weight**
    + b, which adds `x` is called **bias**
2. Define Loss from training data.
    	+ **Loss**: is a function of parameters L(w, b). It means how good a set of values is.
